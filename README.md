##Description

For this assignment you should write an http server in vanilla node that responds to several different routes.

The server should respond to a request to /time that will send back the current time of the server.

It should also respond to a get request to /greet/name where name is any single word string. It should send back a string that greets that name.

It should also have a separate post request to /greet that takes the name in JSON format.


There should be tests using chaiHTTP for both routes, as well as a Gruntfile/package.json
